# GTA_ACLED_TKG

## Steps for reproduction:
### 1. Sparql Queries:
*TODO Lorenz? 

### 2. Timestep Assignment:
* Run 'dataset_preprocessing/ts_assignment_gta_star.py' and 'dataset_preprocessing/ts_assignment_acled.py' to read the .nt files and assign timesteps
* This requires the rdflib package, that can be downloaded here https://github.com/XuguangSong98/rdflib and put into the data_preprocessing folder. Processing data with this package very slow and can take hours to days.
* The output are csv files that can be found in /data/acled and /data/gta respectively

### 3.  Merge the two datasets:
* Run 'dataset_preprocessing/merke-tkg-from-gta-acled.py' to merge both subsets and create train, valid, test.txt
* Specify timerange of interest. In our case this is 2023-01-01 â€“ 2023-12-31
* Split dataset based on timesteps. Specify train/valid/test split. In our case it is 80/10/10
* Automatically stores the resulting files in /data/crisis2023

### 4. Dataset Analysis:
* Run 'dataset_preprocessing/analysis.py' to plot figures of graph parameters over time
* Run 'dataset_preprocessing/tkg_analysis.py' to extract Parameters such as Recurrency Degree and Consecutiveness Degree
